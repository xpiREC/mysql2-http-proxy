# mysql2-http-proxy
A simple HTTP proxy for MySQL, designed for serverless environments like Cloudflare Workers. Inspired by isaac-mcfadyen/mysql-http-proxy 

### ðŸ˜” The Problem
Serverless environments such as AWS Lambda are not suited for database connections. Traditional databases such as MySQL can be easily slowed to a crawl by handling too many connections; plus, as of March 2022, Cloudflare Workers don't even support TCP which relation databases require!

### ðŸŽ‰ The Solution
Enter `mysql2-http-proxy`. It sits on a server and acts as a super-simple database proxy, exposing an HTTP endpoint and ensuring only one connection is ever open to your database at once.

### ðŸ¤” How to Use
Spin up a server anywhere you desire. Clone the repo, rename the `.env.template` file to `.env` and modify your MySQL endpoint, next set the TOKEN_AUTHORIZATION. Run `npm run start` and away you go! ðŸš€


#### request:
The REQUIREMENT is to provide the set token in the header:
```
authorization: Token <YOUR_SET_TOKEN>
```
------------

```

the response to your SQL request in JSON.
